# Examples and Simulations for E-detectors
R scripts to generate examples and simulation results in the following paper.

**E-detectors: a nonparametric framework for sequential change detection**  
J. Shin, A. Ramdas, A. Rinaldo [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03532)

All scripts are based on an R package called [`stcpR6`](https://github.com/shinjaehyeok/stcpR6).[^1]

[^1]: Examples in the original submission were based on a prototyped package called [`stcp`](https://github.com/shinjaehyeok/stcp). But I recommend to use the new scripts based on [`stcpR6`](https://github.com/shinjaehyeok/stcpR6), especially for the simulation as it increased the computational efficiency about 10~20 times.
